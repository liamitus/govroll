/**
 * Derive an accurate bill status from congress.gov actions.
 *
 * Since bill ingest moved from GovTrack to Congress.gov, `fetch-bills.ts`
 * hardcodes every new row to `introduced` and never advances it — so this is
 * the ONLY place a bill's `currentStatus` gets corrected toward reality. The
 * congress.gov action log is the source of truth; this function reads it and
 * returns a corrected status string, or `null` when the stored status already
 * looks right.
 *
 * It must therefore be able to reach every terminal state the rest of the app
 * understands (see momentum.ts `statusFloor` and bill-helpers.ts
 * `getStatusPosition` for the vocabulary):
 *   - enacted_signed — became law
 *   - prov_kill_veto — vetoed by the President
 *   - fail_originating_{house,senate} — voted down in the origin chamber
 *   - passed_simpleres / passed_concurrentres — resolutions adopted
 *   - pass_over_* / passed_bill — bicameral progress
 *
 * Extracted from src/scripts/fetch-bill-actions.ts so both the manual script
 * and the cron route share the same logic.
