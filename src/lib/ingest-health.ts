/**
 * Ingest health evaluation — the detector for the failure modes the per-request
 * cron alerts can't see.
 *
 * The Congress.gov crons stop cleanly on a 429 and resume next run, so a
 * *transient* quota blip is a non-event (and no longer pages). But two real
 * problems hide behind those green runs:
 *
 *   1. SUSTAINED quota exhaustion / a cron that stopped running — the pipeline
 *      silently falls behind. Caught here as a stale cursor: every cursor-based
 *      cron walks its window to `now()` and stamps `updatedAt` on every run
 *      regardless of whether Congress produced anything, so a cursor that hasn't
 *      moved in hours means the cron itself is stuck — not that the Capitol is
 *      quiet. (This is why we key on cursor `updatedAt`, not on data age, which
 *      would false-positive every weekend.)
 *
 *   2. SILENT zero-progress — a cron running green while writing nothing (the
 *      #139 class: refresh-metadata "succeeded" for weeks, stamped nothing).
 *      Caught here as a backfill whose newest progress timestamp has gone stale
 *      while it still has bills queued.
 *
 * This module is pure so it can be unit-tested without a DB; the route gathers
 * the signals and does the alerting.
