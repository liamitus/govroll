/**
 * Dedicated votes-only cron.
 *
 * The main /api/cron/fetch-data runs once a day and handles bills,
 * bill text, cosponsors, momentum, etc. Votes trail at stage 7,
 * which means a recorded roll call that happens right after the
 * cron fires may not appear on the site for ~24 hours — and if the
 * earlier stages exhaust the time budget, the votes stage can get
 * skipped entirely.
 *
 * For the "how did my rep vote?" question — the thing citizens
 * actually care about — that's too slow. This endpoint runs votes
 * in isolation every few hours so a Senate roll call at 6pm ET
 * shows up by 10pm ET, not the next morning.
 *
 * Idempotent: fetchVotesFunction upserts by (representativeId,
 * billId, rollCallNumber), so overlapping windows are fine.
 *
 * Resumable: fetchVotesFunction reads/advances an IngestCursor row and walks
 * from min(saved cursor, now - 2d). The default path re-walks the last ~2
 * days (self-heal for a missed run); a cursor stalled by a longer outage is
 * honored so no roll call in the gap is lost. Pass `?since=YYYY-MM-DD` to
 * force a deep backfill from an explicit date — it advances the cursor
 * per-day, so a backfill bigger than one run's budget resumes on the next.
